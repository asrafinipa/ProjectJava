   /* there are 3 types of variable in java with respect to scope/ visiblity/accessiblity

   1. Local: are defined inside the block of code like if else statement,loop,switch statement methods.
   they can only be accessed within the block of code.
   Advantage:
   They occupy the memory for least amount of time in your computer.
   you should always try go with local variable.
   Disadvantage:
   They can only be accessed within the same block they are created.

   2. Instance Variable= The variable which are defined inside a class but outside a block of code like method,
   if else statement,loop,switch etc. are called as instance variable. They can be access anywhere in the class
   assign the different value to it
   Advantage:
   They can be accessed anywhere inside a class other than static methods.
   Disadvantage:
   They occupy the memory for longer as compared to a local variable

   Static:
   Static variable are created using static keyword they are also created outside of
    blocks of code like methods, loops etc.
    Advantage:
    we can save a lots of space because for static, only one memory location is used for all the objects.
    disadvantage:
    it occupies memory for long time

    Access Modifier:
    access modifiers in java help us the control who can access what. there are 4 access level. we use 3 keyword

    Private:
    most restricted one.native class. only inside class.not be accessible with any other class.
    Public: access from anywhere. universal.
    Default: little flexible than private. from same package.
    Protected: package(inherited)
    important notes:
    1. 99% of the methods is public
    2.99% of the instance fields are created as private
    3.99% of static field are public
    4.99% of the

    // [accessible] returnDataType methodName(paramDataType paramName, paramDataType2 paramName2, ...){
         // do functionalities
        //}
    */
}
