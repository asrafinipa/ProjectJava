Abstraction in java
Abstract means something which is not clear or not complete.
we use abstraction to create methods which are incomplete
(access modifier and signature, they don't have body)
meaning they do not have a body. they only have method headers.
//for polymorphism inheritance and overriding is important.
those methods which are abstract which doesn't have body , every child will have and override .
which methods have body don't need to have abstract

Why Should we create abstract method?
 1)When we know for sure that every child is overriding
  a method we don't need to have a method body.
  2) It acts as a template when we create a method as abstract as
  every child must provide body for that.
  It is used to enforce methods on the child classes


  Interfaces:
Interface is something is common in two systems.
